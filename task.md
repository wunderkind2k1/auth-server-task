# Coding Exercise: Simple OAuth2 Server

## Tasks

*    Create a Golang http server that issues JWT Access Tokens (rfc7519) using Client Credentials Grant with Basic Authentication (rfc6749) in endpoint /token
*    Sign the tokens with a self-made RS256 key
*    Provide an endpoint to list the signing keys (rfc7517)
*    Provide deployment manifests to deploy the server in Kubernetes cluster
*    Create an Introspection endpoint (rfc7662) to introspect the issued JWT Access Tokens

## Remarks

* Publish the exercise in a git server and grant us access to review it.
* Avoid a single commit with the whole solution, we want to see how the solution was developed incrementally.
* Provide instructions to execute it
